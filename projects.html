				<h3> Chalkboard </h3>
				<p>An application to demonstrate basic knowledge of JavaScript events and the canvas. <a href="drawing.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color:#ea9c28;">Click here to open it</a></p>

				<h3>Chat Application</h3>
				<p>In order to learn JavaScript and NodeJS better I created an application designed for chatting across the web. This app was very useful in learning NodeJS and I used a library called Socket.IO which is a staple for applications of this type.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project">
				<h3>Web Radio</h3>
				<p>Inspired by the online radio Pandora, I made an offline application that allowed me to play music. This helped me learn how to use media in the browser as well as useful algorithms</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project">
				<h3>Node Tree and Questionnaire</h3>
				<p>An application created at my internship alone - it was based off editing a node tree that was stored on a database. You could save it for later use, save it to the DB or delete and restart as well as have COMPLETE control over the entire tree. It also had a dynamic UI. This tree was used to represent a questionnaire.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project">
				<h3>Secure Login and Registration system</h3>
				<p>Early in my days of web development I was curious how this type of system was designed - so I decided I would go ahead and make one myself! I learned quickly the uses of PHP in web development, and how to use MySql. I also learned the importance of security and protecting data.</p>

				<h3>Asteroids</h3>
				<p>In my time learning to program, many times my creative outlet was game programming, and coincidentally a great way to learn programming techniques and algorithms as well as enhancing performance of an application. One of my first game development projects was to remake the asteroids game!</p>

				<h3>Battle Simulator!</h3>
				<p>Recently I decided that I wanted to learn a small bit about about artifical intelligence in video games. I got inspired to create something similar to the populat Total War franchise and create my own battle simulator with basic artificial intelligence. I learned a lot about creating large-sized applications and even more about performance, as well as algorithms. I even made a multiplayer game-mode using NodeJS. </p>

				<h3>3d Game Creation</h3>
				<p>In an endeavor to learn more about Game Programming, I decided to learn how to make 3d games. I took up learning an insane amount of things including 3d Model creation, artwork and learning a new game engine all in one month. The end result was something similar to a Diablo game.</p>
